            <p>Charminar is the most famous tourist attraction, and a significant landmark, in Hyderabad. The monument was built in 1591 by Quli Qutub Shah and was named Charminar, because of the four minarets. It is also referred to as the ‘Arc de Triomphe of the East’. Built in an Indo-Islamic architectural style, Charminar is made of limestone, granite, pulverised marble and mortar. Charminar has a small mosque on the top floor. The evening lighting makes it worth watching. Charminar stands in a crowded area where the bazaars are chaotic, with hawkers, bangle sellers and food stalls. Nevertheless, it remains a popular visiting place in Hyderabad.</p>
